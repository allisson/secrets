# 🚀 Secrets v0.2.0 Release Notes

> Release date: 2026-02-14

This release adds operational support for audit log retention cleanup.

## Highlights

- New CLI command: `clean-audit-logs`
- Supports retention by age in days (`--days`)
- Supports safe preview mode (`--dry-run`) before deletion
- Supports machine-friendly output (`--format json`) and human-readable output (`--format text`)

## Included CLI Addition

- `clean-audit-logs --days <n> [--dry-run] [--format text|json]`

Operational behavior:

- Dry-run mode counts matching rows without deleting
- Execution mode deletes rows older than the computed UTC cutoff date
- Works with both PostgreSQL and MySQL repositories

## Runtime and Compatibility

- API baseline remains v1 (`/v1/*`)
- Local development targets: Linux and macOS
- CI baseline: Go `1.25.5`, PostgreSQL `16-alpine`, MySQL `8.0`
- Compatibility targets: PostgreSQL `12+`, MySQL `8.0+`

## Operational Notes

- Use `--dry-run` first for production safety
- Ensure database is reachable and migrated before cleanup runs
- Keep retention execution on a defined cadence (for example monthly)

Example:

```bash
./bin/app clean-audit-logs --days 90 --dry-run --format json
```

## Upgrade Notes

- Non-breaking addition: new CLI command for operations
- Existing API paths and behavior remain compatible under API v1 documentation
