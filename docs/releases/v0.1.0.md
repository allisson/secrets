# 🚀 Secrets v0.1.0 Release Notes

> Release date: 2026-02-14

This is the first public release of Secrets.

## Highlights

- Envelope encryption model with `Master Key -> KEK -> DEK -> Secret Data`
- Transit encryption API for encrypt/decrypt without storing application payload
- Token authentication and policy-based authorization
- Versioned secret storage by path and soft-delete behavior
- Audit logging with request correlation via `request_id`
- PostgreSQL and MySQL runtime support

## Included API Surface

- Auth: `POST /v1/token`
- Clients: `GET/POST /v1/clients`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /v1/clients/:id`
- Secrets: `POST/GET/DELETE /v1/secrets/*path`
- Transit: create/rotate/encrypt/decrypt/delete under `/v1/transit/keys*`
- Audit logs: `GET /v1/audit-logs`
- Health/readiness: `GET /health`, `GET /ready`

## Runtime and Compatibility

- Local development targets: Linux and macOS
- CI baseline: Go `1.25.5`, PostgreSQL `16-alpine`, MySQL `8.0`
- Compatibility targets: PostgreSQL `12+`, MySQL `8.0+`

## Operational Notes

- Restart API servers after master key or KEK rotation so processes load new key material
- Base64 request fields are encoding only, not encryption; always use HTTPS/TLS
- For transit decrypt, pass ciphertext exactly as returned by encrypt (`<version>:<base64-ciphertext>`)

## Known Limitations (v0.1.0)

- `docs/openapi.yaml` is a baseline subset focused on common flows, not full endpoint parity
- API v1 compatibility policy applies to documented endpoint behavior in API reference docs

## Upgrade Notes

- Initial release: no prior upgrade path required
